      <h1>model_browser</h1>
<p>
model_browser is a little helper-plugin to quickly build simple browser
applications solely by defining the underlying model.
</p>
<p>
It is
</p>
<ul>
<li>aimed at developers to help them inspecting database-contents

</li>
<li><b>not</b> fancy looking, but rather basic - at least by now

</li>
<li>quite useful - at least according to my co-workers ;-)

</li>
<li>configurable

</li>
<li>modifyable

</li>
</ul>
<p>
It features
</p>
<ul>
<li>filterable lists of model-objects including pagination

</li>
<li>display of a model-objects attributes

</li>
<li>display of a model-objects related objects

</li>
<li>navigation through the object-relations

</li>
<li>total RESTful-ness

</li>
</ul>
<p>
The underlying concept is, to define a generic controller and generic
view-templates who inspect the model-objects&#8217; attributes and
associations. To tweak the displayed attributes and the attributes used in
index-lists, it provides class methods on <a
href="../classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html">ActiveRecord::Base</a>, thus
allowing to do all browser-configuration in the model-objects.
</p>
<p>
So all you have to do to build a fully functional browser-application is:
</p>
<ul>
<li>include the model_browser-plugin in your application (see Installation for
details)

</li>
<li>define your model-objects

</li>
<li>map routings for your model-objects in routes.rb

</li>
</ul>
<p>
See the Usage- and Example-sections and the plugin-modules&#8217; RDOCs for
details.
</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>
model_browser needs two other plugins to be installed:
</p>
<ul>
<li>controller_prototyping: <a
href="http://cntrlproto.rubyforge.org">cntrlproto.rubyforge.org</a>

</li>
<li>will_paginate: <a
href="http://github.com/mislav/will_paginate">github.com/mislav/will_paginate</a>

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Install these plugins according to their installation instructions.
</p>
<h3>Installation of model_browser</h3>
<p>
Just drop the plugin into your application&#8216;s plugin folder.
</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
As said before (not very DRY, I know ;-)), you can build a navigatable
browser-apllication for your model-classes simply by defining the
model-classes and mapping resource-routes for them. The following
sub-sections describe in more detail, what model_browser provides and how
you can configure the generic features to your needs.
</p>
<h3>Provided views</h3>
<p>
The plugin provides three different views; two of which are
resource-specific and one is of general purpose.
</p>
<h4>The Model Index</h4>
<p>
This view provides a list of all the resources, which you have included in
your routing. Each resource links to the resource&#8216;s index-page. It is
rendered by <tt>model_index</tt>-action of the controller-class <a
href="../classes/ModelBrowserController.html">ModelBrowserController</a>.
</p>
<p>
You might consider routing your application&#8216;s root to that view as
described in section &quot;Defining the routing&quot;.
</p>
<h4>The resource index</h4>
<p>
Each <tt>index</tt>-action on a resource displays a paginating list-view
for the resource&#8216;s instances. The columns of the list depend on the
model-class&#8216;s definition. Each entry is navigatable to the associated
object&#8216;s detail-view. The index-view provides a simple filter
facility to individually limit the display for specific resource-instances
and it supports paginating through the <tt>will_paginate</tt>-plugin.
</p>
<p>
By mapping the model-class as resource, this view is created by the
resource&#8216;s GET-requests, for example
</p>
<pre>
  GET /customers
</pre>
<h4>The resource details view</h4>
<p>
Each <tt>show</tt>-action on a resource-instance displays a details-view
for the object through the <tt>show</tt>-action of <a
href="../classes/ModelBrowserController.html">ModelBrowserController</a>.
As a result of the object&#8216;s inspection, the following information is
rendered:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The object&#8216;s attributes. Which attributes are displayed depends on
the model definition.

</li>
<li>For each of the object&#8216;s associations a list of the associated
target-objects, each entry navigatable to the associated object&#8216;s
detail-view.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
By mapping the model-class as resource, this view is created by the
resource&#8216;s GET-requests, for example
</p>
<pre>
  GET /customers/1
</pre>
<h3>Defining the model</h3>
<p>
For a quick and dirty, no-frills, bare-bones browser you hage to do nothing
special defining your model-classes. model_browser deduces defaults for all
views from the standard <a
href="../classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html">ActiveRecord::Base</a> properties.
</p>
<p>
However, you might consider enhancing your browsing experience by using the
following class methods added to <a
href="../classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html">ActiveRecord::Base</a> by the
plugin.
</p>
<table>
<tr><td valign="top">set_preferred_attributes:</td><td>Call this method with a list of the attributes to restrict the
object&#8216;s detail views. Attributes not contained in this list will be
suppressed. The default behaviour is to include all the object&#8216;s
attributes.

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">set_preferred_index_columns:</td><td>Call this method with a list of attributes to be used on list-views for the
resource. The default behaviour is to use the primary key(s) as columns for
the index list.

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">set_filter_attributes:</td><td>Call this method with a list of attributes to be used for filtering the
index-views. The default behaviour is to use the same attributes used as
columns for the index view.

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">set_display_name:</td><td>Call this method to define a &quot;friendly&quot; name for the
resource-class on the views. This defaults to the model-class&#8216;s
table-name.

</td></tr>
</table>
<h3>Defining the routing</h3>
<p>
Each model-class to browse, has to be mapped in your <tt>routes.rb</tt> as
a resource by
</p>
<pre>
  map.resource :model_class
</pre>
<p>
Additionally you might consider to define a routing to display the
model-index - for example as your application&#8216;s root by
</p>
<pre>
  map.root :controller =&gt; 'ModelBrowserController', :action =&gt; 'model_index'
</pre>
<h3>Styling the views</h3>
<p>
The generated views are plain, ugly, bare-bones html. But fortunately they
are stylable throug css-classes :-)
</p>
<p>
The plugin contains a sample style in it&#8216;s
<tt>public/stylesheets</tt> directory; refer to that to apply the desired
styling to the generated views.
</p>
<h3>Modifiying the default views and controller</h3>
<p>
Of course you can enhance the provided default <a
href="../classes/ModelBrowserController.html">ModelBrowserController</a> by
monkey patching it to your needs.
</p>
<p>
The plugin adds it&#8216;s path with the provided default views to the
<b>end</b> of Rails&#8216;s view-paths. So simply by putting a modified
version of the provided views into your application&#8216;s
<tt>app/views</tt>-folder you can override them.
</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
I&#8216;ll provide a documented sample application showing
model_browser&#8216;s features soon. Stay tuned :-)
</p>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>
Well, at the moment this plugin is at it&#8216;s first working stage, so
there may be a lot of glitches, quirks and errors. However I&#8216;d like
to point out the following limitations, which are addressed as to-do for
the future:
</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no input-checking on the filter-attributes. All you enter is
handed over to the database driver as is. So wrong input formats may simply
yield in exception error pages.

</li>
<li>The index-lists of related objects for a model object&#8216;s associations
are not paginating. If a <tt>has_many</tt> relation has <b>really many</b>
target objects, you&#8216;ll have to wait for the whole result set to be
fetched and rendered and you&#8216;ll get a really long list.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
model_browser is developed and tested with Rails 2.0.2.
